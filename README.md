# Excel customisations

This is a package of customisations for Excel, which are added to a menu called "tantrum". 

These cover various functions: formatting of data, regular expressions, direct editing of SQL queries, a sendkeys function for automating data entry and various others. 

Many of these functions are availale in other, more polished packages (e.g. ASAP utilities). However it's often useful to be able to adapt function to requirement.
