# Excel customisations

This is a package of customisations for Excel, which are added to a menu called "tantrum". 

These cover various functions: formatting of data, regular expressions, direct editing of SQL queries, a sendkeys function for automating data entry and various others. 

Many of these functions are availale in other, more polished packages (e.g. ASAP utilities).
